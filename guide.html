    <p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Did you just recently decide you want to look better by dressing better? Maybe
        you checked out <a href="/r/malefashionadvice/" class="_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU" rel="noopener nofollow ugc"
            target="_blank">r/malefashionadvice</a> and it wasn't for you so you discovered <a href="/r/streetwear/"
            class="_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU" rel="noopener nofollow ugc" target="_blank">r/streetwear</a>. Maybe you like
        hip hop and follow your favorite rappers in IG and you want to look like them. Maybe you're in high school and
        you're sick of getting stunted on by rich kids. Whatever the reason, you found yourself on <a
            href="/r/streetwear/" class="_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU" rel="noopener nofollow ugc"
            target="_blank">r/streetwear</a> looking at inspo albums and WDYWT posts and getting really psyched about
        cool outfits. Then you found some pictures you REALLY fell in love with. You looked up the prices of the items
        in the outfit and immediately lost hope of ever looking like that. Then something led you to <a
            href="/r/FashionReps/" class="_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU" rel="noopener nofollow ugc"
            target="_blank">r/FashionReps</a>. You're pretty new to streetwear. Your daily outfit is jeans and a graphic
        tee with some tennis shoes. Maybe cargos and a zip-up hoodie. Whatever. Point is, you're here to completely
        overhaul your wardrobe and not spend very much money.</p>
    <p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">If I just described you, this is the guide for you. If none of that hits home,
        you probably won't get much out of this guide. There will be zero useful information here for people who have
        been on this sub for a long time.</p>
    <div class="WFFrvt6_3z5B7MBcYKr8U">FashionReps Terms</div>
    <p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">You may be looking at the front page of <a href="/r/FashionReps/"
            class="_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU" rel="noopener nofollow ugc" target="_blank">r/FashionReps</a> and see the
        terms "QC" and "GP" and wonder what the hell are these letters for? Well, how about we explain them.</p>
    <p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"><strong class="_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU">QC:</strong> Quality Control (QC for
        short) is talking about pictures that are posted from an agent of an item that was ordered. Users will post
        these if they're unsure about the quality and would rather have someone else take a look at them if they're good
        enough.</p>
    <p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"><strong class="_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU">LC:</strong> Legit Check (LC for short)
        Much like the name states, this is a tag used for posts requiring a legit check. Legit checks are a great way of
        finding out if a item you're purchasing is authentic or not.</p>
    <p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"><strong class="_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU">GP:</strong> Guinea Pig (GP for short)
        Guinea Pigging is much like being a test subject. In this instance you will be the first person to order a
        sellers new item. This means you'll be the first to get pictures of their product and often times you'll post
        them to be checked for quality by the community.</p>
    <p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"><strong class="_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU">FIND:</strong> Much like the name states.
        Posts with this flair are often linked to new products that haven't been posted before.</p>
    <p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"><strong class="_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU">W2C:</strong> Where To Cop (W2C for
        short) W2C refers to the search for a desired item. Often times will be linked with retail images for an
        example.</p>
    <p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"><strong class="_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU">1:1</strong> One to One (1:1 for short)
        1:1 refers to a perfect replica. However, not many exist and often times you won't be able to get these as
        they're sold out.</p>
    <p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"><strong class="_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU">GL</strong> Green Light (GL for short) GL
        Refers to a user who has given their approval of a QC post.</p>
    <p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"><strong class="_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU">RL</strong> Red Light (RL for short) RL
        Refers to a user who has given their disapproval of a QC post.</p>
    <p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"><strong class="_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU">B&amp;S</strong> Bait &amp; Switch (BS or
        B&amp;S for short) B&amp;S Refers to a seller who has advertised their product and sent goods that are different
        from advertised.</p>
    <p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">&nbsp;</p>
    <div class="WFFrvt6_3z5B7MBcYKr8U">What web sites exist to buy reps from?</div>
    <p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">For our purposes, we're going to pretend that a few of the big web sites don't
        exist. There are lots of sites out there that buy stuff from the web site I'm going to show you how to buy from
        and then sell for double the price. But you're not a sucker. You're going to buy from a weird ass Chinese web
        site and get shit for the low.</p>
    <p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">There's <a href="https://www.aliexpress.com/" class="_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU"
            rel="noopener nofollow ugc" target="_blank">Aliexpress</a> which I do not recommend for several reasons.
        It's very tempting to buy stuff from Aliexpress but you will get burned. First, the site is Western-facing which
        means the pressure is on the site's operators to crack down on illegal activity. Aliexpress is widely used
        around the globe. When there's good fakes on Aliexpress and the link gets shared, the link gets taken away. The
        administrators of the site need to cover their asses and take down things that get reported. So the stuff that
        stays up usually isn't very good.</p>
    <p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">There's <a href="http://www.dhgate.com/" class="_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU"
            rel="noopener nofollow ugc" target="_blank">DHGate</a> which has a lot of good options for if you only want
        to buy one thing, especially "non-hype" shoes like Stan Smiths, Old Skools, Nike running shoes, etc.</p>
    <p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">There's <a href="https://www.taobao.com/" class="_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU"
            rel="noopener nofollow ugc" target="_blank">TaoBao</a>. This is the site we'll be talking about. Here's the
        catch though, it's going to be a little tricky. If you don't want to put in a little work to save a lot of
        money, then give up on reps right now and save up for legit pieces.</p>
    <p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Then there is <a href="https://weidian.com/" class="_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU"
            rel="noopener nofollow ugc" target="_blank">Weidian</a>. This site is very similar to <a
            href="https://www.taobao.com/" class="_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU" rel="noopener nofollow ugc"
            target="_blank">TaoBao</a> in the sense that they have replica goods and it is a bit tricky to get started.
        However, you can find many budget batches here.</p>
    <p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">&nbsp;</p>
    <div class="WFFrvt6_3z5B7MBcYKr8U">I clicked on that TaoBao link and it's all in Chinese. How am I ever going to
        figure this out?</div>
    <p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Chill, we got this. For now, we're not going to worry about navigating TaoBao
        much. That'll come later after you've done a couple orders. Use Google Chrome while rep shopping and utilize the
        full-page automatic translation by <a href="http://i.imgur.com/PhqcGp9.png" class="_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU"
            rel="noopener nofollow ugc" target="_blank">clicking on the translate button</a> in the URL bar. My goal
        right now, however, is not to overwhelm you more because you're probably already overwhelmed so don't worry if
        the site looks really confusing even after translating it.</p>
    <p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">&nbsp;</p>
    <div class="WFFrvt6_3z5B7MBcYKr8U">We're going to use an agent.</div>
    <p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">An agent is a third party with a warehouse that orders things from TaoBao for you
        then repackages all the items you buy from different sellers into one package and sends it on to you. I'm going
        to recommend <a href="https://login.superbuy.com/en/page/login/?partnercode=FashionReps&amp;type=register"
            class="_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU" rel="noopener nofollow ugc" target="_blank">Superbuy</a>. They make it
        pretty easy for new people to buy stuff from TaoBao. Go to the Superbuy home page and paste <a

    <p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Okay, so the catch here is that I'm going to give you the outline of a basic
        streetwear capsule wardrobe for you to build upon. A capsule wardrobe is a wardrobe made up of few pieces that
        are simple and can be combined in many ways to create many outfits. I'll try to include a few simple hype pieces
        because, let's be real, you want to get some hype shit. We all do.</p>

        olive green (very thin, this is a windbreaker not a winter coat). The other tops I'll recommend are Faded Glory
        flannels from Wal-Mart and Hane's Beefy tees. These items are as cheap in the US as they are from TaoBao for the
        most part. If you're not in the US I'm sure there is a local equivalent. If you need a winter coat, I don't
        recommend finding a rep. Quality seriously matters if you live in the frozen north and you don't want to take
        any chances.</p>

    <p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"><strong class="_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU">Shoes:</strong> Replica Shoes are one of
        the hottest categories of replicas right now. However, there are some dos and donts for replica shoes. Here is a
        list of sellers that currently offer a very wide variety of shoes and are trusted within the replica community.
        If you're looking for some basic shoes I definitely recommend going for Boostmaster Lins Budget Ultraboosts.
        Lins Ultraboosts are a great shoe that costs on average $20~$30 and offers the very comfort of retails as well
        with a very close to retail look!</p>

        may be wondering if there is a ability to purchase goods from Taobao without a big hassle. Luckily in the recent
        year we had some new provisions made by sellers and they created sites that are easier to browse than Taobao.
        Now you aren't able to get everything off of these websites but they offer a good starting level for those who
        are looking to not dive into Taobao just yet. I definitely recommend using Superbuy and their $27 worth of

        almost any possible combination and end up with a decent looking outfit. 1 or 2 pairs of pants, 5 or 6 tees, 2
        or 3 hoodies, a couple of flannels, 1 pair of shoes. Lots of combos. And you've spent less than $250, maybe a
        lot less. For the price of one Supreme hoodie, you just built an entire wardrobe. It's basic, yes, but it's a
        start.</p>

    <div class="WFFrvt6_3z5B7MBcYKr8U">How do I know what size to buy?</div>
    <p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">This is a VERY important question. Some products will be reproduced with the same
        original size designations. Others will be shifted to better accommodate their Asian clients. Some items
        purchased from Tao could be a Large that fits like a US XS. So you really need to pay attention.</p>
    <p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">When you find a piece you like, it's time to pick the correct size. Most of the
        time, sellers will have a size chart towards the bottom of the item page. You'll have to scroll down a bit to
        find it.</p>
    <p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">&nbsp;</p>
    <div class="hnYPKCNkyo9X6QpCXHj1I">Here are the translations for sizing:</div>
    <p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"><strong class="_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU">肩宽</strong> - Shoulder Width</p>
    <p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"><strong class="_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU">胸围</strong> - Bust</p>
    <p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"><strong class="_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU">衣长</strong> - Length</p>
    <p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">The surefire way of picking the correct size is to identify the type of item
        you're purchasing (shirt, coat, pants, underwear) and measure an item of that type you own. So, if I wanted to
        buy a bogo tee, and I didn't know my size, I'd take a shirt that fits me, and measure from shoulder seam to
        shoulder seam for shoulder width, pit to pit for bust then x2, and bottom of collar to the bottom for the
        length.</p>
    <p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">The reason you multiply the bust by 2 is because some sellers will have chest
        circumference listed on their chart, so to get your chest circumference just measure pit to pit and x2.</p>

    <div class="WFFrvt6_3z5B7MBcYKr8U">What is shipping going to cost?</div>
    <p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Shipping works a bit differently than you're probably used to. You will pay a
        small fee (5-10yuan) for shipping when you first order the item. Then, once your agent has all the items and
        weighs them, you will pay them for the final shipment of everything from them to you. It is not uncommon for a
        $150 haul to cost $50 to ship. Keep this in mind when you are budgeting your order.</p>
    <p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Some agents will offer a service called <strong
            class="_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU">rehearsal shipping</strong>. Rehearsal shipping is when an agent will
        reweigh your package (for a small fee) to get you the true exact weight. If you feel as if your package weighs
        too much this is a great option to add on.</p>
    <p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">&nbsp;</p>
    <div class="WFFrvt6_3z5B7MBcYKr8U">What shipping option should I choose?</div>
    <p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">There are 3 main shipping options that are frequently used by the FashionReps
        community and are considered the "go-to" options.</p>
    <ul class="_33MEMislY0GAlB78wL1_CR">
        <li class="_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz">
            <p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">DHL - Fast shipping times (average at 3~7 business days) DHL is great for
                EU packages as it tends to have a lesser seizure rate. US can use DHL too.</p>
        </li>
        <li class="_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz">
            <p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">EMS - Fast shipping times (average at 5~9 business days) EMS is great for
                US packages.</p>
        </li>
        <li class="_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz">
            <p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">China Post - Slow shipping times (average 15~30 business days) China Post
                is great if you're looking to ship for a low price and are fine with your items taking a while to
                arrive.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">&nbsp;</p>
    <div class="WFFrvt6_3z5B7MBcYKr8U">But, OP I want hype shit.</div>
    <p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">I know, me too and so does everyone else who is new to <a href="/r/FashionReps/"
            class="_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU" rel="noopener nofollow ugc" target="_blank">r/FashionReps</a>. As a general
        rule, get all the basics before you get any hype. If you wear too much hype or wear hype shit before you figure
        out how to match and create a good outfit, you'll look bad. I know it's tempting to just put on a full Supreme
        outfit but you will look like an idiot.</p>
    <p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">However, I can't stop you from needing to satisfy your itch for cheap hype. Start
        with just tee shirts. Seriously. With stuff other than tees (jackets, pants, embroidered items, etc.) there's a
        lot more that can go wrong and you don't have a trained eye for details yet. It will come with time and with
        looking at posts on this sub.</p>

        don't have X. Where do I get it?</div>
    <p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">The easiest way to find a specific item is to use the <a
            href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FashionReps/search?q=&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=relevance&amp;t=all"
            class="_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU" rel="noopener nofollow ugc" target="_blank">Search Bar</a> on this
        subreddit. Check out links, reviews, etc. If you don't see it, your instinct is probably to create a new thread
        and ask for links. Please don't do this until you have already tried to find it for yourself. It is so rewarding
        to hunt down and find an item that no one has posted before. It also helps keep the front page of the sub
        unclogged with repetitive posts.</p>
    <p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">As you know, TaoBao is mainly in Mandarin Chinese. So typing in "Supreme red tee
        shirt" won't get you too far. So we use a function on TaoBao called the reverse image search. <a
            href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FashionReps/comments/4zebsp/guide_searching_taobao_by_image_video_and_picture/"
            class="_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU" rel="noopener nofollow ugc" target="_blank">Here's a nice simple guide</a>
        to using reverse image search by our mod <a href="/u/mikeygigs18/" class="_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU"
            rel="noopener nofollow ugc" target="_blank">/u/mikeygigs18</a>. Only addendum I make to that guide is that
        sometimes to change TaoBao to "Mainland China" it's in the upper left corner of the page rather than the bottom
        bar.</p>

        influx of new users, people being mean, whatever, just remember that we're all here for the same reason. We want
        to look good for the low. So just chill and don't be dicks.</p>
    <p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Also, if you comment with a question and no one replies then your comment is
        being hidden because you are on a reddit account with not enough karma. Go participate in some discussions in
        other subreddits to build up a little so you can post and comment here.</p>
